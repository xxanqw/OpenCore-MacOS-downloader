 Simple python based console app to easilly download MacOS files for OpenCore<br>
I am not related to Opencore in any way. Just made program without need to download all opencore package, search for macrecovery etc.
Everything is simple download, put in any folder, open, choose, wait, thats all!
<a href="https://github.com/xxanqw/OpenCore-MacOS-downloader/releases"><h3>Download</h3></a>

###Only MacOS section
For Mac download source code from release, then install wget:
```
pip3 install wget
cd Downloads/OpenCore-MacOS-downloader-X.X
python3 opencoremacosdwnldr.py
```
Also on Mac you need <a href=python.org/downloads/>Python 3</a> in other way it won't work at all.<br><a href="https://youtu.be/WQB56K-zFjE">How to use it (video)</a>
