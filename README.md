 Simple python based console app to easilly download MacOS files for OpenCore<br>
For Mac and Linux download source code from release, then install wget:
```
pip3 install wget
cd opencoremacosdwnldr
python3 opencoremacosdwnldr.py
```

I am not related to Opencore in any way. Just made program without need to download all opencore package, search for macrecovery etc.

Everything is simple download, put in any folder, open, choose, wait, thats all!
