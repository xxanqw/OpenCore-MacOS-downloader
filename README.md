 Simple python based console app to easilly download MacOS files for OpenCore<br>
I am not related to Opencore in any way. Just made program without need to download all opencore package, search for macrecovery etc.
Everything is simple download, put in any folder, open, choose, wait, thats all!

### MacOS and Linux section
For Mac/Linux download source code from release, then install wget and gdown:
```
pip3 install wget
pip3 install gdown
cd Downloads/OpenCore-MacOS-downloader-X.X
python3 opencoremacosdwnldr-macos/linux.py
Only for Linux - install "unzip" with apt-get or with your install manager.
``` 
Also on Mac you need <a href="https://python.org/downloads">Python 3</a> in other way it won't work at all.<br><a href="https://youtu.be/WQB56K-zFjE">How to use it (video)</a>
